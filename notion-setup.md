# Notion Setup Guide for Enhanced Integration

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to set up Notion databases for enhanced integration with AstroNot. The enhanced integration allows you to manage various aspects of your website directly from Notion, including projects, services, testimonials, work experience, and about page content.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Notion databases, make sure you have:

1. A Notion account
2. Created a Notion integration and obtained an API key
   - Go to [https://www.notion.so/my-integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
   - Click "New integration"
   - Give it a name (e.g., "AstroNot Integration")
   - Select the capabilities required (Read content, Update content, Insert content)
   - Click "Submit" to create the integration
   - Copy the "Internal Integration Token" (this is your `NOTION_KEY`)

## Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:

```
# Notion API Key
VITE_NOTION_KEY='your_notion_api_key_here'

# Notion Database IDs
VITE_PROJECTS_DB_ID='your_projects_database_id_here'
VITE_SERVICES_DB_ID='your_services_database_id_here'
VITE_TESTIMONIALS_DB_ID='your_testimonials_database_id_here'
VITE_WORK_EXPERIENCE_DB_ID='your_work_experience_database_id_here'
VITE_ABOUT_DB_ID='your_about_database_id_here'
```

> **Note**: If you don't want to use a specific Notion database, simply omit the corresponding environment variable. The website will fall back to using the configuration files in the `src/config` directory.

4. In the content area of the database entry, add paragraphs of text that will be used as the about page content

5. Share the database with your integration
6. Copy the database ID and add it to your `.env` file as `VITE_ABOUT_DB_ID`

## Using the Enhanced Notion Integration

Once you have set up the Notion databases and added the environment variables, the website will automatically fetch data from Notion when it is built or when the development server is started.

If a specific Notion database ID is not provided or if there is an error fetching data from Notion, the website will fall back to using the configuration files in the `src/config` directory.

This approach provides flexibility and ensures that the website works even without Notion integration.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Notion integration, check the following:

1. Make sure the Notion API key is correct
2. Make sure the database IDs are correct
3. Make sure the databases are shared with your integration
4. Make sure the database properties match the expected format
5. Check the console for error messages

If you continue to experience issues, you can disable the Notion integration for specific components by removing the corresponding environment variables from your `.env` file. The website will then use the configuration files in the `src/config` directory as fallbacks.
