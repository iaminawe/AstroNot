## Development Workflow
- **Local Development**: Developers use `pnpm dev` to start the local development server.
- **Building**: The website is built using `pnpm build` for production.
- **Syncing Notion Content**: Notion content is synced using `pnpm sync`.
- **Generating Production Build**: The production build is generated using `pnpm generate`.

## Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Unit Tests**: Unit tests are written for critical components and functions.
- **Integration Tests**: Integration tests are written to ensure that different parts of the system work together correctly.
- **End-to-End Tests**: End-to-end tests are written to simulate user interactions and ensure that the website works as expected.
- **Code Quality**: Code quality is maintained using linting and formatting tools.

## Deployment
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: The CI/CD pipeline is used for automated testing, building, and deployment.
- **Environment Variables**: Environment variables are used to manage configuration settings.
- **Monitoring**: The website is monitored for performance and uptime, with alerts set up for critical issues.

## Performance
- **Lighthouse Scores**: AstroNot receives a **100** on Lighthouse Desktop and **99** for Lighthouse Mobile tests on sample Blog Posts.
