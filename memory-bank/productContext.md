# Product Context

## Purpose
AstroNot aims to provide a powerful, flexible, and customizable site builder that leverages the strengths of both Astro and Notion. The primary goal is to offer users the ability to write, edit, and publish content directly from Notion while having full control over the website's design and functionality.

## Problems Solved
- **Limited Customization**: Many existing Notion site builders offer limited customization options, forcing users to adhere to a predefined layout.
- **Performance Issues**: Some solutions may not prioritize performance, leading to slower page loads and a poor user experience.
- **Integration Challenges**: Seamless integration with Notion for content management is crucial, but many solutions fall short in this area.

## How It Works
- **Notion Integration**: AstroNot syncs Notion content, including pages, images, and tags, with the website. This ensures that all content is up-to-date and easily manageable.
- **Customizable Design**: By exporting Notion content into MarkdownX, users can fully customize the website's design and styling.
- **Performance Optimization**: Built with the FAST stack (Flowbite, Astro, Svelte, Tailwind), AstroNot ensures fast page loads and smooth navigation transitions.

## User Experience Goals
- **Ease of Use**: Provide an intuitive interface for users to manage their content and design.
- **Customization**: Offer a wide range of customization options to cater to different user needs and preferences.
- **Performance**: Ensure that the website performs well, with fast load times and smooth transitions.
- **SEO-Friendly**: Optimize the website for search engines to improve visibility and reach.

## User Personas
- **Content Creators**: Individuals who want to create and manage content easily.
- **Developers**: Users who want to customize the website's design and functionality.
- **Business Owners**: Individuals who need a flexible and customizable site builder for their business.

## Competitive Landscape
- **Super.so**: A popular Notion site builder that offers limited customization and is not open-source.
- **Notion CMS**: Another option that integrates Notion with various platforms but may lack the customization and performance features of AstroNot.

## Market Opportunity
- **Growing Demand**: There is a growing demand for flexible and customizable site builders that integrate with Notion.
- **Open-Source Advantage**: AstroNot's open-source model can attract developers and users who value transparency and community contributions.

## Product Vision
AstroNot aims to provide a flexible and customizable site builder that integrates seamlessly with Notion for content management.
