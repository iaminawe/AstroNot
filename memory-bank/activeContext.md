 # Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on refining the Notion integration capabilities and improving the overall user experience. The Notion integration has been successfully implemented and tested, with services, projects, testimonials, and author information now being correctly pulled from Notion databases. The Memory Bank has been updated to reflect these changes and ensure that all components work together seamlessly.

  - About page content database for personal information
  - Social Links database for managing social media links
  - Home Hero database for customizing the homepage hero section
  - Site Settings database for managing global site settings (title, logo, favicon, meta tags, etc.)
- Created configuration files for various components of the website:
  - `src/config/about.ts` for about page content
  - `src/config/contact.ts` for contact form
  - `src/config/email.ts` for email functionality
  - `src/config/hero.ts` for homepage hero section
  - `src/config/resume.ts` for resume timeline
  - `src/config/services.ts` for services section
  - `src/config/testimonials.ts` for testimonials section
- Enhanced the contact form to send emails via SMTP
- Added a case studies carousel to the home page
- Fixed the publish_date error in the LatestPosts component
- Created a resume timeline view and integrated it into the about page
- Made Notion integration optional by using config files as fallbacks
- Created reusable components that use Notion data with config fallbacks:
  - SocialLinks component for displaying social media links
  - Enhanced FeatureHero component to use Home Hero database
  - Updated Layout component to use Site Settings database
  - Updated PostLayout component to use Author database
- Integrated dynamic content in multiple places:
  - Social links in author bio, about page, and footer
  - Home hero section with customizable title, subtitle, description, image, and CTAs
  - Global site settings for title, logo, favicon, meta tags, and SEO

## Next Steps
- Apply static generation to all Notion content types:
  - ✅ Projects: Implemented static generation by creating markdown files at build time
  - ✅ Testimonials: Implemented static generation by creating JSON data at build time
  - ✅ Services: Implemented static generation by creating JSON data at build time
  - ✅ Home Hero: Implemented static generation by creating JSON data at build time
  - ✅ Work Experience: Implemented static generation by creating JSON data at build time
  - ✅ Social Links: Implemented static generation by creating JSON data at build time
  - ✅ Author Information: Implemented static generation by creating JSON data at build time
  - ✅ Notion Images: Implemented script to download and localize Notion images
- Create detailed documentation for setting up Notion databases for enhanced integration (including examples of database structures and property configurations)
- Implement error handling improvements for Notion API requests based on recent testing
- Review and update the documentation as needed based on new insights or changes in the project
- Continue with the development and maintenance of the AstroNot project, ensuring that all changes are documented in the Memory Bank
- Regularly update the Memory Bank to reflect the current state of the project, including new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements
- Implement additional features based on user feedback and requirements

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Documentation Priority**: Ensuring that the Memory Bank is up-to-date and accurate is a top priority to maintain clarity and consistency in the project's development and maintenance.
- **Performance Optimization**: Continuously monitor and optimize the performance of the website to ensure fast page loads and smooth navigation transitions.
- **Security**: Implement and maintain robust security measures to protect the website and its users from potential threats.
- **User Experience**: Focus on providing a seamless and intuitive user experience, with a strong emphasis on customization and ease of use.
- **Optional Notion Integration**: Make Notion integration optional by providing fallback mechanisms using configuration files, allowing users to choose whether to use Notion for content management.

## Open Issues
- **Project Performance**: Projects page and individual project pages load significantly slower than blog posts, requiring optimization to match blog post performance.
- **Notion API Limits**: Need to monitor and manage the Notion API usage to avoid hitting rate limits and usage quotas.
- **Compatibility**: Ensure that the website is compatible with different browsers and devices to provide a consistent user experience.
- **Performance**: Continuously optimize the website's performance to ensure fast load times and smooth transitions.
- **Security**: Regularly update and patch the website to protect against known vulnerabilities and ensure data protection.
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure proper handling of environment variables for Notion integration, especially in client-side code.
- **Markdown Rendering**: Ensure consistent rendering of Markdown content from Notion across different page types (posts vs. projects).

## Key Insights
- **Flexibility and Customization**: AstroNot's ability to export Notion content into MarkdownX allows for full customization of the website's design and styling.
- **Performance**: The FAST stack ensures that the website is built for performance, with fast page loads and smooth navigation transitions.
- **Static Generation vs. Dynamic Loading**: Blog posts using static generation perform significantly better than projects using dynamic loading, highlighting the importance of build-time data processing.
- **Notion Integration**: Seamless integration with Notion for content management is crucial for the success of AstroNot.
- **Open-Source Advantage**: AstroNot's open-source model can attract developers and users who value transparency and community contributions.
- **Configuration Files**: Using configuration files as fallbacks for Notion integration provides flexibility and ensures the website works even without Notion.
- **Error Handling Strategy**: Implementing robust error handling with fallbacks to configuration files ensures the site remains functional even when Notion API calls fail.
- **Markdown Rendering Consistency**: Using libraries like marked for consistent Markdown rendering across different page types improves content display reliability.
- **Build-time vs. Runtime Data Fetching**: Moving data fetching from runtime to build time significantly improves page load performance and user experience.
- **Static Site Generation Pattern**: All Notion content should be fetched during the build process and converted to static files or data, rather than fetched at runtime. This pattern should be applied consistently across all content types.
- **Image Localization**: Notion image URLs are temporary and expire after a certain period. To ensure images remain accessible, they should be downloaded and stored locally during the build process.
- **S3 Integration for Images**: For production environments, Notion images can be uploaded to S3 instead of stored locally, providing better scalability and reliability. The system automatically detects S3 credentials and uses the appropriate storage method.
