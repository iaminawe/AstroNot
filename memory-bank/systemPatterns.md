# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
AstroNot is built using the FAST stack, which includes Flowbite, Astro, Svelte, and Tailwind. This stack is chosen for its performance, flexibility, and ease of use.

## Key Components
- **Astro**: The core framework that handles server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes.
- **Flowbite**: A UI framework built on top of Tailwind CSS, providing a collection of design elements and components.
- **Svelte**: A front-end framework that compiles components to highly efficient vanilla JavaScript at build time.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development with customizable design components.

## Data Flow
1. **Notion Content Sync**: Notion content is synced to the AstroNot website using the Notion API. This includes pages, images, and tags.
2. **MarkdownX Export**: Notion content is exported to MarkdownX, allowing for full customization of the website's design and styling.
3. **Astro Build**: The Astro framework builds the website, optimizing images and generating static files for performance.
4. **Svelte Components**: Svelte components are used for interactive elements and dynamic content.
5. **Tailwind CSS Styling**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling the website, providing a consistent and customizable design.

## Design Patterns
- **Component-Based Architecture**: The project is built using a component-based architecture, with reusable components for different parts of the website.
- **State Management**: Svelte's nanostores are used for state management, ensuring that the website's state is consistent and predictable.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive, with a mobile-first approach and adaptive layouts for different screen sizes.
- **SEO Optimization**: The website is optimized for search engines, with fast page loads, smooth navigation transitions, and meta tags for better visibility.

## Performance Optimization
- **Image Optimization**: Images are optimized at build time, ensuring fast page loads and improved performance.
- **Code Splitting**: Code splitting is used to load only the necessary JavaScript for each page, reducing the initial load time.
- **Caching**: Caching is used to store frequently accessed data, reducing the need for repeated API calls and improving performance.

## Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: The website is designed to degrade gracefully, ensuring that users can still access content even if certain features fail.
- **Error Logging**: Errors are logged and monitored, allowing for quick identification and resolution of issues.
- **Fallbacks**: Fallbacks are provided for critical features, ensuring that the website remains functional even if certain components fail.

## Security
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: A CSP is implemented to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and other code injection attacks.
- **HTTPS**: The website is served over HTTPS, ensuring that data is encrypted in transit.
- **Input Validation**: Input validation is used to prevent SQL injection and other injection attacks.
- **Regular Updates**: The website is regularly updated with security patches and updates to protect against known vulnerabilities.

## Deployment
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: A CI/CD pipeline is used for automated testing, building, and deployment of the website.
- **Environment Variables**: Environment variables are used to manage configuration settings, ensuring that sensitive information is not hard-coded.
- **Monitoring**: The website is monitored for performance and uptime, with alerts set up for critical issues.

## Performance
- **Lighthouse Scores**: AstroNot receives a **100** on Lighthouse Desktop and **99** for Lighthouse Mobile tests on sample Blog Posts.
- **Image Optimization**: Images are fetched and optimized at build time, resulting in page loads much faster than the native Notion pages.
- **View Transitions**: AstroNot supports Chrome's new `View Transitions` API, resulting in smooth navigation transitions and page animations in supported environments.
