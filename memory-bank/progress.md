  - Updated Svelte Inspector to the latest version (`^4.0.1`).
  - Updated `astro.config.mjs` to include the Svelte Inspector plugin.
  - Updated `memory-bank/techContext.md` to reflect the latest dependencies and integration points.

- **Enhanced Notion Integration**: Added support for multiple Notion databases:
  - Author database for managing blog post author information
  - Projects database for showcasing work
  - Services database for displaying offerings
  - Testimonials database for client feedback
  - Work Experience database for professional history
  - About page content database for personal information
  - Social Links database for managing social media links
  - Home Hero database for customizing the homepage hero section
  - Site Settings database for managing global site settings (title, logo, favicon, meta tags, etc.)

- **Configuration Files**: Created configuration files for various components of the website:
  - `src/config/about.ts` for about page content
  - `src/config/contact.ts` for contact form
  - `src/config/email.ts` for email functionality
  - `src/config/hero.ts` for homepage hero section
  - `src/config/resume.ts` for resume timeline
  - `src/config/services.ts` for services section
  - `src/config/testimonials.ts` for testimonials section

- **UI Enhancements**:
  - Added a case studies carousel to the home page
  - Created a resume timeline view and integrated it into the about page
  - Enhanced the contact form to send emails via SMTP
  - Fixed the publish_date error in the LatestPosts component
  - Created reusable components that use Notion data with config fallbacks:
    - SocialLinks component for displaying social media links
    - Enhanced FeatureHero component to use Home Hero database
    - Updated Layout component to use Site Settings database
    - Updated PostLayout component to use Author database
  - Integrated dynamic content in multiple places:
    - Social links in author bio, about page, and footer
    - Home hero section with customizable title, subtitle, description, image, and CTAs
    - Global site settings for title, logo, favicon, meta tags, and SEO

- **Optional Notion Integration**: Made Notion integration optional by using config files as fallbacks, allowing users to choose whether to use Notion for content management.

## What's Left to Build
- **Notion Setup Documentation**: Create detailed documentation for setting up Notion databases for enhanced integration.
- **Detailed Feature Documentation**: Document each feature in more detail including specific implementation details user flows and integration points.
- **Integration Testing**: Implement and document integration tests to ensure that different parts of the system work together correctly.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Write end-to-end tests to simulate user interactions and ensure that the website works as expected.
- **Performance Optimization**: Continuously monitor and optimize the website's performance to ensure fast page loads and smooth transitions.
- **Security Measures**: Implement and document robust security measures to protect the website and its users from potential threats.
- **User Experience Improvements**: Focus on providing a seamless and intuitive user experience with a strong emphasis on customization and ease of use.

## Current Status
- **Development Phase**: The project is currently in the development phase focusing on core features and performance optimization.
- **Documentation Complete**: The initial documentation for the project's requirements context system patterns and technical context is complete.
- **Development in Progress**: The development of the AstroNot project is ongoing with a focus on performance optimization and security.
- **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Unit tests integration tests and end-to-end tests are being implemented to ensure the quality and reliability of the website.
- **Enhanced Notion Integration**: The project now supports multiple Notion databases for dynamic content, with configuration files as fallbacks.
- **Notion Integration Verified**: All Notion integrations have been tested and confirmed to be working correctly, including services, projects, testimonials, and author information.
- **Markdown Rendering Improved**: Enhanced Markdown rendering for projects using the marked library to ensure consistent content display across different page types.

## Known Issues
- **Project Performance Gap**: Projects page and individual project pages load significantly slower than blog posts, requiring optimization to match blog post performance.
- **Notion API Limits**: Need to monitor and manage the Notion API usage to avoid hitting rate limits and usage quotas.
- **Compatibility**: Ensure that the website is compatible with different browsers and devices to provide a consistent user experience.
- **Performance**: Continuously optimize the website's performance to ensure fast load times and smooth transitions.
- **Security**: Regularly update and patch the website to protect against known vulnerabilities and ensure data protection.
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure proper handling of environment variables for Notion integration, especially in client-side code.
- **Markdown Rendering Edge Cases**: Some complex Markdown structures from Notion may require additional handling for proper rendering.
- **Error Handling Refinement**: While basic error handling is in place, more sophisticated error handling strategies may be needed for production environments.

## Next Steps
- **Apply Static Generation Pattern**: Apply static generation to all Notion content types:
  - ✅ **Projects**: Implemented static generation by creating markdown files at build time
  - ✅ **Testimonials**: Implemented static generation by creating JSON data at build time
  - ✅ **Services**: Implemented static generation by creating JSON data at build time
  - ✅ **Home Hero**: Implemented static generation by creating JSON data at build time
  - ✅ **Work Experience**: Implemented static generation by creating JSON data at build time
  - ✅ **Social Links**: Implemented static generation by creating JSON data at build time
  - ✅ **Author Information**: Implemented static generation by creating JSON data at build time
  - ✅ **Notion Images**: Implemented script to download and localize Notion images
- **Create Notion Setup Documentation**: Develop detailed documentation for setting up Notion databases for enhanced integration, including examples of database structures and property configurations.
- **Refine Error Handling**: Implement more sophisticated error handling for Notion API requests based on recent testing.
- **Review and Update Documentation**: Regularly review and update the documentation to reflect the current state of the project including new features bug fixes and performance improvements.
- **Implement Integration Tests**: Write and document integration tests to ensure that different parts of the system work together correctly.
- **Implement End-to-End Tests**: Write and document end-to-end tests to simulate user interactions and ensure that the website works as expected.
- **Performance Optimization**: Continuously monitor and optimize the website's performance to ensure fast page loads and smooth transitions.
