# Troubleshooting Guide

## Navigation Issues

### Port 3000 in URLs
If you notice port 3000 appearing in URLs when navigating between pages:

1. **Browser Caching**
   - This is often due to browser caching
   - Try viewing in a private/incognito window
   - Clear browser cache if issue persists

2. **URL Handling**
   - The Navbar and Footer components have been updated to handle URLs consistently
   - URLs are now formatted with a single leading slash
   - BASE_URL dependency has been removed to prevent conflicts

### Navigation Not Working
If navigation between pages is not working:

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - Look for any JavaScript errors
   - Verify all required scripts are loading

2. **Client-Side Routing**
   - Ensure Astro's client-side routing is properly configured
   - Check for any conflicting route definitions

3. **Component Links**
   - Verify all links use the correct format: `href="/path"`
   - Avoid using relative paths without leading slashes

## Image Loading

### S3 Images Not Loading
If images from S3 are not displaying:

1. **Check S3 Configuration**
   - Verify AWS credentials are correct
   - Ensure bucket permissions allow public access
   - Check S3 region configuration

2. **Image Component**
   - The Image component now properly handles S3 URLs
   - S3 URLs are passed through directly without processing
   - Local images still use Astro's image optimization

### Image Optimization Issues
If images are not being optimized correctly:

1. **Build Process**
   - Run `npm run sync:images` to force image sync
   - Check build logs for any optimization errors

2. **Cache Issues**
   - Clear the `.astro` cache directory
   - Rebuild with `npm run build`

## Development Tips

1. **Local Development**
   - Use `npm run dev` for local development
   - Changes to navigation components require a restart

2. **Production Testing**
   - Build with `npm run build`
   - Test with `npm run preview`
   - Use private browsing for cache-free testing

3. **Deployment**
   - Always test in a production environment
   - Verify all environment variables are set
   - Check S3 configuration in production

## Coolify Integration Issues

### Webhook Authentication
If you encounter "Unauthenticated" errors with Coolify webhooks:

1. **Check Secrets**
   - Verify `COOLIFY_WEBHOOK_URL` is set correctly in GitHub secrets
   - Ensure `COOLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` is set and matches Coolify's expected token
   - Double-check for any whitespace in the token value

2. **Webhook Format**
   - Webhook URL should be complete (including https://)
   - Auth token should be the full token from Coolify
   - Content-Type must be application/json

3. **Common Issues**
   - "Unauthenticated" usually means token is missing or incorrect
   - HTTP 404 means webhook URL is incorrect
   - Empty response might indicate network/firewall issues

4. **Debugging Steps**
   - Check GitHub Actions logs for masked URL and response headers
   - Verify webhook response status code
   - Look for specific error messages in response body
   - Test webhook URL format and accessibility
