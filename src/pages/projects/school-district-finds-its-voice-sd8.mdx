When a school district with 25 separate schools struggled to provide consistent information to parents and students, I developed a network of AI assistants that transformed their communication approach. 


The system, trained on the district's website data and policy documents, now effortlessly answers questions about everything from bus schedules to budget allocations. 


A central district-level AI handles general inquiries, while school-specific assistants provide detailed information about individual campusesâ€”all while keeping educational data secure and private.
