The WWOOF (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms) organization had country-specific websites operating on disparate content management systems, leading to inconsistent user experiences, operational inefficiencies, and challenges in global coordination.


**Solution**: Initially, in 2014, I undertook a significant project to upgrade WWOOF Canadaâ€™s website from Drupal 6 to Drupal 7, requiring a complete rebuild and content migration. Following the success of this project, the Federation of WWOOF Organizations approached me to create a large Drupal multi-site platform to unify all WWOOF country sites into a single global entity.


**Role**: As the lead developer and designer, I was responsible for scoping, planning, designing, and leading a small team in building this complex platform. I implemented a high-performance Aegir-based solution across multiple AWS servers. Each country site was multilingual and included private messaging and e-commerce components operating in their local currencies.
