# Maps for Makers


**CartoCuts: Turning Any Location into High-Resolution Engraved Art**


![cartocuts-screensnap.png](https://greggcoppen.s3.ca-central-1.amazonaws.com/project-fb6360fd941f30132bd97fd8f17c9dd3eeac485f58950aeb1ee26d3f376835bc.png)


## **Client Overview**


**CartoCuts** is a unique SaaS platform that allows users to generate **high-resolution, laser-ready topographic maps** for engraving on wood, ceramic, and other materials. The platform was built to streamline the process for artisans, makers, and businesses looking to create customized geographic artwork.

## **The Challenge**


Before CartoCuts, **creating engraved topographic maps was complex and time-consuming**. Users had to:


•	**Manually source and clean GIS data** from public sources.


•	**Use advanced design software** like QGIS or Adobe Illustrator to prepare laser-cut-ready files.


•	**Struggle with accuracy and scaling issues**, leading to production inefficiencies.


**Goal:**


To develop an intuitive, web-based platform where users could **select any location worldwide and instantly generate a laser-engraving-ready map**—eliminating the technical barriers for creators.
